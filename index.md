As a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Michigan State University, my work explores the life cycles of compact binaries in dense star clusters. My research stands on three pillars:

Observation: I analyze multi-wavelength data (X-ray, optical, radio) from telescopes like Chandra and XMM-Newton to study the properties of sources like black hole candidates and ULXs.

Simulation: I use theoretical modeling, including N-body and Monte-Carlo simulations, to investigate how the dense cluster environment dynamically shapes the evolution of these objects.

Data Science: I apply advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms to classify astrophysical sources and for the challenging task of denoising and detecting gravitational wave signals.
