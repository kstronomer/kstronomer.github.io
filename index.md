I am an observational and computational astrophysicist and a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Michigan State University. My primary research goal is to understand the complex interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics in the universe's densest environments, globular clusters. To achieve this, I employ a multi-faceted approach:

Multi-wavelength Observations: I lead observational projects analyzing the X-ray, optical, and radio properties of compact objects. Chandra and optical data to unravel its accretion physics and evolutionary state. I have also conducted detailed multi-epoch X-ray imaging of globular clusters.

Dynamical Simulations: I utilize large-scale N-body and Monte-Carlo simulations to model the evolution of compact binary populations. This theoretical work allows me to interpret observational data within a physical framework, for example, by studying how cluster dynamics affect the evolution of pulsars and cataclysmic variables.

Advanced Data Analysis: I develop and apply machine learning techniques to analyze complex astrophysical data, including classifying X-ray sources in crowded fields.
