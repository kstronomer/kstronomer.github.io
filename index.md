I am an observational and computational astrophysicist and a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at Michigan State University.  
My research investigates the formation, evolution, and observational signatures of compact binaries and black holes in globular clusters. I combine X-ray, optical, and radio observations with advanced simulations to explore exotic systems such as ultracompact X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and millisecond pulsars and other binaries with high-energy phenomena. To achieve this, I employ a multi-faceted approach:

Multi-wavelength Observations: I lead observational projects analyzing the X-ray, optical, and radio properties of compact objects. Chandra and optical data to unravel its accretion physics and evolutionary state. I have also conducted detailed multi-epoch X-ray imaging of globular clusters.

Dynamical Simulations: I utilize large-scale N-body and Monte-Carlo simulations to model the evolution of compact binary populations. This theoretical work allows me to interpret observational data within a physical framework, for example, by studying how cluster dynamics affect the evolution of pulsars and cataclysmic variables.

Advanced Data Analysis: I develop and apply machine learning techniques to analyze complex astrophysical data, including classifying X-ray sources in crowded fields.
