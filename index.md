### ðŸ”­ About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Michigan State University studying the formation and evolution of compact binaries in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters.

My research combines multiwavelength observations (X-ray, radio, optical) with theoretical modeling and simulations.
